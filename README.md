# Algorithms Part 1 (By Princeton University) Assignments
A repository containing the source code for the assignments in Algorithm Part 1 on Coursera.org.  
Link of the course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2  
This repository contains 5 assignments:
  - WordNet (Graph Processing)
  - SeamCarving (Graph Processing)
  - Baseball Elimination (Maxflow problem)
  - Boggle (Tries)
  - Burrows-Wheeler (Data compression)
 ## How to run the solution
 ### 1. Download the third-party Java library provided by Princeton University
 The solutions in the assignments all use the library provided in the course so you need to download it first in order to run and test 
 the solutions.  
 You can download each class needed for each solution or you can simply download the whole solution from the course's website: 
 https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/  
 ### 2. Download the project folder from the assignment specification webpage
 The project folder containing all the test data and the supporting classes (that not provided in the library above) can be downloaded in the specification webpage for each assignment.
